# 2048
Implementation of the 2048 sliding puzzle by Gabriele Cirulli using jQuery 3.4.1 and jQuery UI 1.12.1. Play the game here:

https://sloebrich.github.io/2048/

Use the arrow keys to slide all tiles on the board in one direction. 
Whenever two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a new tile of twice their value. 
After every move, a new tile is randomly created in the box.
Can you build a 2048 tile before the box is full?
